**Course:** 67-336 Building Data Visualization into Information Systems  
**Instructor:** Shihong Huang  
**TAs:** Wenchao Hu, Lexi Kronowitz  

**Due Date:** TBD  
**Submission Format:** **Observable Notebook Link & Tableau Public Dashboard Link**

## Assignment Overview

This take-home assignment provides an opportunity to analyze public safety data using Tableau. You will create two interactive dashboards using publicly available datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). Your work should uncover meaningful insights and demonstrate best practices in visual storytelling and dashboard design. In addition to building dashboards in Tableau, you will create a project write-up and reflection in Observable.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze and visualize real-world public safety data in Tableau.
- Identify meaningful trends and patterns in Pittsburgh crime data.
- Apply principles of interactivity and design in dashboard creation.
- Communicate findings in a reproducible and web-published Observable notebook.
- Reflect critically on your analytical and design decisions.

---

## Dataset

Use the following datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC):

- [Police Incident Blotter](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/police-incident-blotter)
- [Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data)

Review the metadata, variable descriptions, and time ranges. You may choose to filter, clean, or transform the data prior to visualization.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Data Story

Begin by selecting a focused analytical question or theme. Your data story should be specific and supported by the data. Suggested directions include:

- Trends in crime over time (by week, month, or year)
- Spatial distribution or hotspots by neighborhood or zone
- Patterns by time of day or day of week
- Distribution of crime types or severity
- Relationship between incident types and arrest frequency

Clearly articulate the story your visualizations aim to tell.

---

## Step 2: Build Two Interactive Dashboards in Tableau

Using Tableau, develop two separate dashboards, each providing a distinct perspective on your data story. The dashboards must be interactive, allowing users to explore the data through filters, tooltips, or other user actions.

Example dashboard formats include:

**Dashboard 1: Time-Series Analysis**  
- Show trends over time (e.g., incidents by month or week)  
- Include filtering by crime type or location  
- Use tooltips to show incident details  

**Dashboard 2: Geographic or Categorical Analysis**  
- Map view of incident or arrest locations by neighborhood or zone  
- Filters for incident category or time range  
- Use color, shape, or size to indicate patterns  

Publish both dashboards to Tableau Public and ensure they are publicly accessible.

---

## **Step 3: Create an Observable Notebook**

Use Observable (https://observablehq.com/) to create a dashboard that serves as your final project report. Your dashboard should include:

- An introduction to your project and data story
- Embedded links (or screenshots) to your Tableau dashboards
- Written analysis of your findings
- Your reflection section (see Step 4)
- Any exploratory visualizations or summary statistics you want to include
- Citations or references to data sources

**Your Observable notebook must be published (unlisted or public) and shared via a link.**

---

## Step 4: Write a Reflection (in Observable)

Include this reflection as a section within your Observable notebook. Address the following questions (600-800 words):
- What data story did you focus on, and why?
- What insights emerged from your analysis?
- What design decisions did you make, and what were your reasons?
- What challenges did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?
- What would you change or improve with more time?

## Submission Requirements

Submit the following:

1. A working link to your Observable notebook
2. A working link to your Tableau Public dashboards  

Ensure your submissions are viewable without login or permission requests.

## Notes

- Pay attention to design details: labels, axes, color usage, and interactivity should enhance clarity.
- Avoid excessive visual decoration (chartjunk).
- Ensure your dashboards and Observable notebook are accessible to a general audience.
- Your Observable notebook should serve as your central write-up and submission portal. Treat it like a live data report.
